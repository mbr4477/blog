I recently completed my PhD at the University of Kentucky researching deep learning for monitoring the condition of machines on a factory floor. I'm currently a data scientist for the Cleveland Guardians MLB team.

Outside of work, I recently got married (!) to Emma. I help lead a small group at my church. I used to do more music production but haven't done much recently.

Some books I'd recommend right now are *Delighting in the Trinity* by Michael Reeves, *Strangely Bright* by Joe Rigney, *Range* by David Epstein, and *Soundtracks* by Jon Acuff. *Knowing God* by J. I. Packer is good, too, but I haven't finished it yet.

In August 2022 I visited Mexico City for the CASE2022 conference, and then in October 2022 I visited Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Parks with my family. In the past few years I've also visited Kenya and the Middle East.

Everyone has a favorite kind of math, and mine is probabilistic modeling.
