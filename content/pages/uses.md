## Notes

I keep some notes as [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) but don't always update it frequently. I don't use Obsidian but stick to [Typora](https://typora.io/), an excellent cross-platform, minimalist, and themable markdown editor. 

## Productivity System

I recently switched to using a single Notion page for basically everything:
inline database of todos, inline database of recipes, shopping list, tracking auto maintenance, storing important values like VIN numbers, license numbers, etc. Once place for everything.
For tasks, I have an approach somewhat similar to Getting Things Done (GTD), I think. 
I track items as Not Started, Next, Today, In Progress, and Done and tag them as Important, Urgent, or both.

## Laptops

I split time between a late-2013 MacBook Pro (Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD)
and a 2019 HP Spectre x360 (Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD).

## Phone

I currently have an iPhone 12 Mini.
