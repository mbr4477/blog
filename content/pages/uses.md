## Notes

I keep some notes as [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) but don't always update it frequently. I don't use Obsidian but stick to [Typora](https://typora.io/), an excellent cross-platform, minimalist, and themable markdown editor. Day to day notes are split between the iPhone Notes app and Google Keep.

## Task Management

I have an approach somewhat similar to Getting Things Done (GTD), I think. I use Trello with lists for an inbox, task backlog, ready to go tasks, things nice to get done today, today's tasks, and then miscellaneous other lists to keep things in one spot (long form notes that should go in my zettelkasten, recipes, etc.).
All my task cards can have important and/or urgent labels to priortize them.

## Laptops

I split time between a late-2013 MacBook Pro (Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD)
and a 2019 HP Spectre x360 (Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD).

## Phone

I currently have an iPhone 12 Mini.
